# Yong-Woo Lee / 이용우 / 李鎔宇

Welcome! I am a phd student studying in the Department of Mathematical Sciences in Seoul National University, advised by [Sung-Soo Byun](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsoobyun/welcome)). I am interested in probability theory and complex analysis, especially on random matrix theory.

I am a student member of [SNU Probability Group](https://sites.google.com/view/snuprob/).
